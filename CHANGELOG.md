            - Durability multiplier of 28.
            - 2 toughness points per piece.
            - Enchantability of 22. (close to Gold)

            - Armor: 7 defense points
            - Leggings: 5 defense points
            - Boots: 3 defense points
            - Overall, the armor set is slightly worse than Diamond, with a better chance of getting a good enchantment.

			- Grants identical stats compared to Gapples, but is eaten instantly.
			- To prevent from eating multiple consecutively, there is a 3-second cooldown before you can eat another golden head.  (Shouldn't be a big deal, but could also double as a nerf for the item)

                - Furious Zombie:

                    - Resistance I

                    - Warrior Zombie ~
                        - Iron Helmet and Chestplate
                        - Stone Sword
                    - Weak Warrior Zombie ~
                        - Leather Helmet
                        - Wooden Sword
                - Sword Zombies:
                    - Weak ~ Golden Sword

        - In easy mode, the chances of spawning with a weapon is the same as vanilla.
        - The point of this change was to make normal zombies a more annoying-to-deal-with mob, than just a mere punching bag. Now, you're forced to deal with large groups of zombies with more skill required, than just slaying them in one hit with your smite 5 netherite sword.

	<GUI Changes>
	- The EnhancedCraft mod currently comes with a custom GUI pre-configured, but it can be customized via the options inside of the Mod Menu config.

        - In hard mode, zombies will always spawn with a class, with a 25% chance to spawn with a hard-mode class.
            - These zombies have a lowered chance to drop their hard-mode-only gear (2.5% chance instead of 8.5%).
            - Hard Classes:
                - Furious Zombie:
                    - Netherite Sword with Sharpness 4

                    - Speed IV
                    - Always able to pick up loot
                - Tank Zombie:
                    - Enchanted Diamond Sword with Sharpness I - IV
                    - 3/4 Diamond Set (diamond helmet is excluded)

                    - Resistance I
        - In normal mode, zombies will have a 50% chance of spawning with a normal zombie class.
            - Normal Classes:
                - Warrior Zombies:
                    - Warrior Zombie ~
                        - Iron Helmet and Chestplate
                        - Stone Sword
                    - Weak Warrior Zombie ~
                        - Leather Helmet
                        - Wooden Sword
                - Sword Zombies:

                    - Metal Alloy in off-hand
        - In easy mode, the chances of spawning with a weapon is the same as vanilla.
        - The point of this change was to make normal zombies a more annoying-to-deal-with mob, than just a mere punching bag. Now, you're forced to deal with large groups of zombies with more skill required, than just slaying them in one hit with your smite 5 netherite sword.

        - Crafted by combining fire charges with gunpowder.

        - Smart Pearls have a unique sound effect when the user teleports, to differentiate it from normal Ender Pearls.

## beta-1.3.3
Halloween update?

No, actually though, that update took way longer than it should've: almost two weeks instead of a day or two! Anyways, enjoy beta-1.3.3 while I work on beta-1.4.

### Changes
	- Added set bonuses for custom armor!
		- Etherium Set Bonus:
			- Set Bonus: Etherium Enrage
				- Killing an entity will grant you one enrage level.
				- Enrage Level 1: Strength I for 5 seconds.
				- Enrage Level 2: Strength II for 5 seconds.
				- Enrage Level 3: Strength II and Absorption II for 5 seconds. Enraged player now glows and plays a SoundEvent.
				- Enrage levels are capped at level 3. If you do not kill an entity within the time strength lasts, your enrage levels will reset.
				- Huge thanks to sschr15 for many of the code and help! Very appreciate it man, and godspeed to you if you see this!
			- You get Absorption 2, Speed 3, and Jump Boost 1 if under 4 health (2 hearts).
			- You get permanent Resistance II and 10 extra hearts.
			- SoundEvent ques that indicate when a buff has been activated.
			- Multiplayer support.
	- Removed unnecessary ItemGroup. Will be reimplemented in a later patch.
	- Quality of Life Changes:
	    - Options Background, Hotbar Icons, Widgets, Hotbar, and the enchanted item glint can now be changed in the AutoConfig menu accessible via Mod Menu.
	    - Changed default enchantment glint... again
	        - Tired of the blinding cyan lightning color that used to be part of EnhancedCraft? Now, it has been replaced with a cool and clean purple/magenta gradient!
	        - Enchantment glint can, of course, be customized with the config menu available inside of the Mod Menu.

	- Fixes:
		- Fixed MAJOR compatibility issue surrounding creative ItemGroups with other mods.
		- Fixed MAJOR ore-spawning issue, where Etherium wasn't being spawned. You may have to walk into a new chunk you haven't loaded before to find etherium.
			- Etherium nows spawns up to once per chunk, with up to 5 per vein.
		- Etherium ore now reacts differently when used with the fortune enchantment.
			- Fortune II and above will give you a chance to drop 1 - 3 etherium instead of 1.
		    - Fortune I will unfortunately result in no boost in drop rate.

## beta-1.3.2
More Halloween updates muahahahhhahahahahahhahahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

### Changes
	- Made a ghetto portal mechanic. It kinda sucks, but it works in the meantime.
	- Verified the concept where entering specific dimensions with specific armor pieces and tools will grant debuffs. This is now officially and internally called "Deterioration".
		- To avoid "Deterioration", you must quickly swap out of "foreign" tools and armor.
		- If you do not avoid "deterioration", you will receive the following debuffs.
			- "Deterioration" and Slowness if wearing "foreign" armor.
			- Mining Fatigue and Weakness if holding "foreign" tools.
			- Added a new status effect: Deterioration.
				- Deterioration is just a superiorly nastier withering effect. It will deal 2.5 damage every 0.5 seconds, effectively killing a player in 4 seconds (slower due to natural regeneration and other factors.)
	- New (albeit experimental) blocks! These blocks have been temporarily added as placeholders for an upcoming dimension update. Currently the blocks don't drop anything are only accessible via creative inventory.
		- Fortisteel Ore (otherstone and earthstone variant.)
		- Purigold Ore (otherstone and earthstone variant.)
		- Cobalt Ore (otherstone exclusive.)
		- Otherstone.
		- Earthstone.
	- Quality of Life Changes:
		- You can now make arrows out of bronze ingots instead of flint, iron ingots, metal alloy, or cobblestone. Arrows made this way are made in batches of 8.
		- Shears can now be made from bronze.
		- Anvils can now be made from bronze.
		- Changed up the GUI textures. Credits to Lucy, the maker of Nebula 16x for some of the textures :)
		- Changed all of the Etherium textures. Credits to Lucy, the maker of Nebula 16x for the textures. You really make great packs! :)
		- Changed the icon.png
	- Fixes:
		- Fixed block variants of ores not dropping theirselves when mined.


## beta-1.3.1
Oooh, it's Halloween month, and some spooky updates are here! Muahahahhahhahahahhahhaahhahahahha

	- Added a haunted entity to the game, his name we shall not speak of or his bad omens will follow.
		- When sleeping, he has a 1/100 chance to haunt you, leading to a jumpscare, and Blindness and Nausea for 10 seconds. Also, any Nether Portals within a 16 chunk radius will be broken.
	- Added a test dimension called "enhancedcraft:mirrored_dimension" to test and debug dimensions.
	- Significantly buffed Etherium Armor.

		- Nerfed vein size from 15 to 12.

	- Buffed Gemstone Apple's effects.
		- Added Fire Resistance for 30 seconds.
		- Now gives Regeneration 2.
	- Buffed Bronze Axe.
		- Now deals 8 hearts of damage.
			- This is to make it a competent competitor to the Stone and Iron Axe. It undercuts the Iron and Stone Axe in terms of raw damage, but has higher DPS.
	- Tested a concept where entering specific dimensions with specific armor pieces equipped will apply nasty debuffs. Currently functional but still testing.
	- Tested a concept where holding and using certain tools in certain biomes will grant nasty debuffs. Currently functional but still under testing.
	- Quality of Life Changes:
		- You can now make arrows out of iron ingots instead of flint or cobblestone. Arrows made this way are made in batches of 16.
		- You can now make arrows out of metal alloy instead of flint, cobblestone, or iron. Arrows made this way are made in stacks.
