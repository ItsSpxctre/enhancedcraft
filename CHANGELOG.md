# ENHANCEDCRAFT CHANGELOG

## beta-1.3

This beta update introduces support for FabricSkyBoxes, as well as some changes and bug fixes.

### Changes
    - OPTIONS_BACKGROUND is now customizable! We have created a mod menu that allows for configuration.
    - Quality-of-Life Changes
        - Changed the crosshair. Some people didn't want to play Minecraft like an FPS lol.
        - Changed the Enchanted Item Glint. Now looks epic as fuq
        - Changed "Tom Yum" to "Tom Yum Kong".
        - Added a custom attack indicator.
        - Added flesh-to-leather capability without additional mods, via smelting only.
        - Added granite-to-cobble capability without additional mods, for those who don't want granite, diorite, or andesite, (aka the ugly & useless blocks).
        - Added cheap-arrow capability for those who hate flint. Now you can craft an arrow with cobblestone, albeit less efficient.
    - Added Block of Etherium.
    - Add custom skybox. (For OptiFine users)
    - Adds skybox dependency. (No we're not, we reverted this.)
    - 1.16.3 is supported alongside 1.16.2.

    - IMPORTANT: Fixed block madness.
        - All tools previously were broken, in that they were not following block mining level rules. This has been patched.
