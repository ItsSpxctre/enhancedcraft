# EnhancedCraft
### Minecraft. Enhanced.

Long gone are the days of choosing between plain vanilla Minecraft or big, game-changing Minecraft mods. It's time for a mod that adds more content to the game whilst revolving around the core mechanics and gameplay of Minecraft.

This is EnhancedCraft: a mod designed to add more powerful weapons and tools, new blocks, and cool mechanics, whilst still being Minecraft at its core. Look at some of our mod's features!
- New ores!
- New tools and weapons!
- New biomes and dimensions! (COMING SOON)
- New mobs! (COMING SOON)
- Canvas Renderer support! (IN DEVELOPMENT)
- etc.


#### DISCLAIMER
This mod is officially in Open Beta! You can download this mod at https://www.curseforge.com/realspectr3x/enhancedcraft, from our GitHub Releases, or clone the project and build it yourself!

If you would like to help contribute to the project, please email me at (realspectr3x@vort3xmedia.cf) to be invited to the development of the project. You are free to contribute to the project, but please do not re-distribute this mod or do any other form of piracy, as this mod is free anyways and I am a young programmer who is working hard to make these mods.
