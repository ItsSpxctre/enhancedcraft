# EnhancedCraft
### Minecraft. Enhanced.

Long gone are the days of choosing between plain vanilla Minecraft or big, game-changing Minecraft mods. It's time for a mod that adds more content to the game whilst revolving around the core mechanics and gameplay of Minecraft.

This is EnhancedCraft: a mod designed to add more powerful weapons and tools, new blocks, and cool mechanics, whilst still being Minecraft at its core. Look at some of our mod's features!
- New ores!
- New tools and weapons!
- New biomes and dimensions! (COMING SOON)
- New mobs! (COMING SOON)
- Canvas Renderer support! (IN DEVELOPMENT)
- etc.
#### How To Get Started

This guide assumes that you're using the default Minecraft Launcher. If you use MultiMC, updating your mods should be more self-explanatory. This guide also assumes that you already have the Fabric ModLoader set-up. If you do not, go to this [link](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install "Fabric Installation Guide"), and download Fabric at this [link](https://fabricmc.net/use/ "Fabric Download Link")

If you want to get the mod for yourself, go the CurseForge [link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhancedcraft/ "yes") or the Releases tab on GitHub.

Find the latest release, and Download.
![CurseForge Example](https://i.gyazo.com/c1e6210caae86852853605417f57cd17.png "CurseForge")

Make sure the [Fabric API](https://gyazo.com/33cc93e6d6e13b3963397a0a3c5e1906 "Required By The Mod") is installed as well. Without the Fabric API, most mods (including this one) will not launch correctly, and many of the content will not be loaded.

Next, you'll want to navigate to your `.minecraft\mods` folder. If you're using the Minecraft Launcher, this should be located in your `%appdata%` folder.

Press `Win + R` to open the Run window, type in `%appdata%`, and press enter.

In the folder that pops up, navigate to the `.minecraft` folder, in the `mods` folder, drag the Fabric API and the mod `.jar` into it.

![.minecraft Folder](https://i.gyazo.com/e735a1f171288c872b4afc385cea1cbe.png ".minecraft Directory")
![Mods Folder](https://i.gyazo.com/9c7adad429c019d033cdcc3d38ebf9b3.png "Mod Directory")

Now your mod should be working! Just make sure that you are launching with the Fabric loader in Minecraft's launcher. If not, the mod will not load, nor will any of your other mods.

#### Verify Your Install

If you want to check that your mod is installed, you can install the [Mod Menu GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu "Mod Menu GUI") mod, which will display all of your installed mods, including EnhancedCraft. Note that [Mod Menu GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu "Mod Menu GUI") also requires the Fabric API, so this mod will not load if the Fabric API is not installed.

Alternatively, you can look in-game to check your survival hearts.

As of Beta-1.2, the hearts and the GUI have been slightly altered. This allows you to differentiate if the mod has been downloaded or not, or have been installed correctly. Also, these glossy hearts look absolutely amazing, and they should never be overwritten.

#### Contribute
This mod is officially in Open Beta! You can download this mod at [from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhancedcraft/ "yes"), from our GitHub Releases, or clone the project and build it yourself!

I will be making content related to the mod on my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/Spectr3x "Spectr3x's YouTube Channel"), so you can stay updated by subscribing! Other than that, I will be occasionally livestream to Twitch, sometimes on the mod, so you are free to check there as well. [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/realspectr3x "My Inactive Twitch")

If you would like to help contribute to the project, please email me at (realspectr3x@vort3xmedia.cf) to be invited to the development of the project. You are free to contribute to the project without being directly invited, but please do not re-distribute this mod or do any other form of piracy, as this mod is free anyways and I am a young programmer who is working hard to make these mods. Feel free to make your own YouTube mod showcases on this mod! You don't have to ask permission; all I ask is that you notify me of it and give credit to me!
